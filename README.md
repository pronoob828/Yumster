It's my first time using PHP, and ohh boy have I figured out why some people despise is. It's so easy to write spaghetti code as a newbie. I really should have used functions for certain things, they *might* 
have cleaned things up. Either way, a fun learning experience and definitely not bad for my first time. First impressions of PHP have been great, can't wait to learn Laravel some time.
